## Entrainment of Molecular-Temperature Cloud in Galactic Winds

The following series of videos are from my cloud-crushing simulations. A cloud-crushing simulation consists of a cloud embedded in a background wind. By cloud, I simply mean a cold, overdense region that is in pressure equilibrium with the wind, which is at a higher temperature. Depending on the parameter choices, this simulation can be a good approximation to many terrestrial and astrophysical phenomena. (one example would be the motion of clouds in the Earth's atmosphere)
In the context of galaxy formation, cloud-crushing simulations are used to study how cold clouds originating from the interstellar medium (ISM) of a galaxy gets accelerated by galactic winds powered by supernova explosions. The clouds that survive this process then populates the circumgalactic medium (CGM), which is a diffuse halo of (baryonic) gas surrounding a galaxy.
