## About Me

Hi! My name is Zirui. I am interested in theoretical and computational astrophysics. 

A list of my publications can be found [here](https://ziruichen11.github.io/publications/), which was last updated on November 8, 2023.

I earned my undergraduate degrees in Physics and Astronomy at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), where I was a [John Jay Scholar](https://www.college.columbia.edu/alumni/jj-scholars-program), a [Junior Phi Beta Kappa](https://www.pbk.org/), and graduated with latin honors (Summa Cum Laude) and departmental honors. During my undergrad, I had the pleasure to work with [Greg Bryan](http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~gbryan/Site/home.html) (Columbia) and [Drummond Fielding](https://dfielding14.github.io/) ([CCA](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/)) on developing analytic models for turbulent radiative mixing layers in galaxies, and with [David Kipping](http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~dkipping/index.html) (Columbia) at the [Cool Worlds Lab](https://www.coolworldslab.com/) on transit patterns of circumbinary planets. 

In Fall 2022, I am going to start pursuing my (Astro)physics PhD at [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.physics.ucsb.edu/), where I will be working with [Siang Peng Oh](http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~peng/), partially supported by the [James and Mary Jo Hartle Graduate Fellowship](https://giving.ucsb.edu/Funds/Give?id=348).
